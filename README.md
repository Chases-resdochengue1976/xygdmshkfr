oh man... just walked out of Deva, my brain is still in an. absolute. whirlwind. like a salad spinner, but the salad is all fiery emotions and chaos—not some leafy calm, you feel me? theater was buzzing like, always is, sound of popcorn crushed under sneakers. someone left their candy wrapper crinkle solo symphony. 

> okay, remember that one scene, flames everywhere? i swear i could almost feel the heat on my face, maybe it was just the broken heater in theater, but still. it's like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 reaches out and just wraps around you? deva in those moments, kinda felt like a dragon, not just fiery flame-thrower biz, but more knowing of ancient things? or am i just losing it? ugh my back though... cursed seats with less support than a worn, sad pancake.

and the colors, where'd they even get those colors? it's like opening a bag of skittles in a tornado. picture every flying skittle screaming a different emotion at you. that's deva, it kinda demands, yells at you to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , live it.

is it weird if i say it made me think of cooking? like pulling together sweet and burning and salty all at once, but it's not food, it's your mind? those clashes of flavor, err... scenes. maybe i'm just hungry? ah wait, leftovers... my mind’s on a tangent train again, no stops.

also, so much fighting. but the kind of fighting like when you're trying to open a jar of pickles and it puts up a battle. bam! aggression but still you're craving that sense of satisfaction in the end—you know? i think i even saw someone wake up wildly from a midnight popcorn nap next to me just at the climax. all i could do not to laugh.

back to the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮... unforgettable, like a burnt pot that somehow you cherish? like who knew confusion could be so vivid?

and don't get me started on the music, like a bebop jazz band in a blender.. chaotic but somehow making sense, no idea how they pull that off.
